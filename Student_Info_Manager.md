## 🗓️ Day 1 Reflection

This project was built on **Day 1 of learning Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** in Python.  
After learning the basics of:

- `class` and `object`
- `__init__()` constructor
- `self` keyword
- defining and using methods
- storing objects in a list
- looping with conditionals

I applied them to build this [Student Info CLI App](stuinfomanager.py)

It helped me understand how real-world data (like students) can be managed using classes, and how to make interactive terminal-based apps using loops and logic.
